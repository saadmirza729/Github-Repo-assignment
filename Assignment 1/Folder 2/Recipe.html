    <h1><b>Biryani Recipe – A Flavorful Delight</b></h1>

    <p>Biryani is a popular South Asian rice dish known for its rich aroma, colorful appearance, and irresistible taste.
        It is a blend of fragrant basmati rice, tender meat (usually chicken or beef), and a mix of exotic spices. This
        dish is often reserved for special occasions, but with a little effort, anyone can prepare it at home. <br>

        <br>To make biryani, start by marinating 500 grams of chicken in yogurt, ginger-garlic paste, red chili powder,
        turmeric, garam masala, and salt. Let it rest for at least an hour to absorb the flavors. In the meantime, soak
        2 cups of basmati rice for 30 minutes. Then boil the rice with whole spices like bay leaves, cloves, cardamom,
        and cinnamon until it is 70% cooked. Drain and set it aside. <br>
        <br>In a large pot, heat oil and fry thinly sliced onions until golden brown. Remove some for garnishing. Add the
        marinated chicken and cook until the meat is tender and the oil separates. Now, layer the cooked rice over the
        chicken in the same pot. Sprinkle fried onions, fresh coriander, mint leaves, saffron milk, and a little ghee
        between layers. Cover the pot tightly and cook on low heat (dum) for 20-25 minutes. <br>

        <br>The steam allows all the flavors to blend beautifully, giving the biryani its signature taste and aroma. Once
        done, mix gently and serve hot with raita or salad. <br>

        <br>In conclusion, biryani is more than just a dish—it’s an experience. Each bite offers a burst of flavor that
        tells a story of tradition and culture. Whether for a family dinner or a festive celebration, biryani is sure to
        impress and satisfy.</p>
