    <h1><b>The Art of Cooking Biryani</b></h1>

    <p>Biryani is a flavorful and aromatic rice dish that has been cherished across South Asia and the Middle East for
        centuries. It is a perfect blend of fragrant basmati rice, tender meat, and a medley of spices that create a
        rich and satisfying meal. The preparation of biryani requires patience and precision, but the result is a dish
        that is both comforting and celebratory. <br>
        <br>To begin, the rice must be washed and soaked to ensure a fluffy texture. It is then partially cooked with whole
        spices such as bay leaves, cardamom, and cloves to infuse it with fragrance. Meanwhile, the meat—whether
        chicken, lamb, or beef—is marinated with yogurt, ginger-garlic paste, and a mix of spices, including turmeric,
        cumin, and garam masala. This step enhances the flavor and tenderness of the meat. <br>
        <br>The next crucial step is layering. In a deep pot, caramelized onions are spread at the base, followed by the
        marinated meat and partially cooked rice. Saffron-infused milk and ghee are drizzled over the layers to add
        richness and color. The pot is then sealed and cooked on low heat, allowing the flavors to meld together through
        the traditional "dum" method. <br>
        <br>After about 20-30 minutes, the biryani is ready to be served. Garnished with fresh coriander and fried onions,
        it is best enjoyed with raita or a side of pickles. The beauty of biryani lies in its versatility—variations
        such as Hyderabadi, Lucknowi, and Sindhi biryani each bring unique flavors and techniques to the dish. <br>
        <br>Biryani is more than just a meal; it is a culinary experience that brings people together, celebrating tradition
        and taste in every bite.
